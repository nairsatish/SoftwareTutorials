# SoftwareTutorials
These are tutorials made either for the CS 4590 course or for the Neural Modeling manual later on.

To do:
Talk about what labs were done in what order in the CS 4590 course in Fall 2023 here:
Talk about what is on B1 - B3 and how they work.

B3:

  1.Add question about changing input current in first simulation and seeing how input resistance is a constant.


B2:
  1. add the graph ofindividual segments' voltage in again, and limit the x-axis and title it Transience in Voltage(takes some time) Take that from:
https://github.com/davidfague/Computational-Neuroscience-tutorials/blob/main/B2_CableTheory.ipynb
 
  2.Graph Voltage over distance every 50 times steps to show how it is not instant and ask why(some has to go to charge the capacitor before it starts leaking). 

  3. Add questions about how the length constant changes in response to different things(like membrane resistance, axial resistivity, and diameter)
