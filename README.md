# SoftwareTutorials
These are tutorials made either for the CS 4590 course or for the Neural Modeling manual later on.

B2:
  1. add the graph ofindividual segments' voltage in again, and limit the x-axis and title it Transience in Voltage(takes some time) Take that from:
https://github.com/davidfague/Computational-Neuroscience-tutorials/blob/main/B2_CableTheory.ipynb
 
  2.Graph Voltage over distance every 50 times steps to show how it is not instant and ask why(some has to go to charge the capacitor before it starts leaking). 

  3. Add questions about how the length constant changes in response to different things(like membrane resistance, axial resistivity, and diameter)


To do:
Talk about what labs were done in what order in the CS 4590 course in Fall 2023 here:
Talk about what is on B1 - B3 and how they work.


B1:
  1.

  2.

  3.

B2:
  1.
  
  2.
  
  3.
B3:
  1. Goes over what input resistance, the fact that it is a constant, and how to calculate it.
     
  2. Goes over what the FI curve is and plots it for the given cell from the currents -1nA to 2nA.
     
  3. Goes over what Nodes of Ranvier and Myelin sheaths are and how they contribute to AP propagation down an axon. It also shows how certain factors affect the propagation speed.
