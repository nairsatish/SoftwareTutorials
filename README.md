# SoftwareTutorials
These are tutorials made either for the CS 4590 course or for the Neural Modeling manual later on.


B3:

Find neuron default values for nodes of ranvier and myelinated sheaths.
Add question about input resistance for different current.
Should node of ranvier values be same as axon?



B2:

add the individual segments in again, and limit the x-axis and title it Transience in Voltage(takes some time) Take that from:
https://github.com/davidfague/Computational-Neuroscience-tutorials/blob/main/B2_CableTheory.ipynb
Graph Voltage over distance every 50 times steps to show how it is not instant(some has to go to charge the capacitor before it starts leaking). 
have it graph every 50 time steps of the voltage since only the max voltage at the end is shown. why is not instant(some has to charge the capacitor beforehand before it starts leaking out)
Add questions about how the length constant changes in response to different things(like membrane resistance, axial resistivity, and diameter)
